* Intro
- 1 Week till next sprint deadline
- 4 front end and 2 back end
- 2 back end portions of stories are done
- Front end and back end members will be touching every story
- UML should be exactly as implemented but generally common sense
- Sketched Sequence diagram is a good level of detail
    + But functions should be named appropriately
- Do sequence diagramming for major stories
    + Roughly 5
- Node isn't needed for paths that require authentication
- Whatever we get feedback for, should be provided for next sprint
- Prefer 1 repository
- Need a completed project by sprint 4
- Every story delivered must have test cases. But you should have 3-4 test
  cases per story
    + Stories aren't complete without test cases
