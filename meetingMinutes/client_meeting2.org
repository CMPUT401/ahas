* Intro
- App will be on a web server
* What we are doing
- CRUD
- Contact management
* Considerations
- You would need some kind of data connection
    * Data requirement will be small because it's mostly passing text
- Using a touch input tablet right now. No writing recognition
- Hoping to use a Lenovo Mix 320 tablet
- Doesn't use the tablet in either portrait or landscape
    * Switches between the two
* Demo
- We have space for microchip and tattoo
- Create client
      - Mandatory client information:
          * Wants a "How did you hear about us field"
      - Alternative contact doesn't need to be required
      - Phones and email shouldn't be mandatory
- Create patient:
    - Will have to turn off requirements for last 2 fields
    - Sex instead of gender
    - Want sex and reproductive status combined together
        - male
        - male neutered
        - Female
        - Female spayed
        - Unknown
    - Wants birth date instead of age
        - Wants age to be dynamic
    - Make fields drop down menus
- Medical records:
    - Wants option to select check all
        - BAR and all Ns
    - Switch bottom buttons to radio buttons
    - Want to be able to set a date for vaccine follow up
    - Medications and vaccines will need a check up date
    - Wants a column for medications and vaccines to state what date to
      recheck them â†’ wants an indicator to recheck next date
- Contacts:
    - They want a 4th field: techs
    - Vets, volunteers, laboratories, and techs
