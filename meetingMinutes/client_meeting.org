* Intro
<2017-01-25 Wed>
- Don't need invoicing
- Have inventory, which is slightly anomalous
- Just want something simple and useable
- Will send us a PMR
- We can go on a call if we want to
- Connie Varnhagen is a website admin for ahas
* Requirements Discussion
- There is a sample ppt that demos their UI/what they need
- PPT is a rough idea of what they need/want
- Want database to search for clients by first name, last name and phone
- Client = owner
- Patient = pet. Pets inherit client last name
- Patients are owned by clients
- Search for volunteer, and vet names → would be nice. Not critical
    + Search for anyone in the system (on contacts list)
- Need some contact info
- Client list and patient list is critical
** Client list
- Search bar for first name, last name → could do fuzzy search
- Comes up with a "flash card of information" or file record
- Don't care about gender
- Care about address
- 1 to many phone number
- Email would be nice → clients probably don't have email
- Need to cover for alternative caregiver (2nd client authorized as a
  caregiver for the pet) → basically a confidentiality agreement
    + Name and phone for alternative caregiver. Don't care about other stuff
- Client must be registered as some kind of low income person
    + Must provide capability to show eligibility has been verified
        * Y/N/Waiting
- Animal ID: tattoo/chip. Can be both
** Patient list
- Same as client list
- Search by last name, patient name
    + Scrollable list
- Ability to access actual view of record
    + Full info
    + Animal ID: rabies tag number
    + Must be attached to the client
    + Shows client info, pet info
    + Reminders section is very important
        * When vaccines are due
        * Must have notification of reminders? → should ask client
        * Reminders change colors if overdue in some programs
    + Like to have a picture of pet,
    + Quick summary of what they've had done
        * Scrollable
- Likes red for alerts
- Need vaccine history
- Medication list is important
    * That they've ever been on
- Lab results is important to have as well
    * Scan into file somehow
- Perhaps just have a general notes/documents attachment field
- Need to have some way to look at radiology
    + Come via email, and attached to file → need to know image format
*** New notes for day should be implementable
- Need to have all parties information
- Notes can be typed
- Animal diagram
    + Be able to draw on it somehow
- Notes need to be opened and read
- Windows tablet
- Must be a signature → very important
- Connie needs to be asked how long notes can be editable
    + Probably at least 1 day till they get locked
    + Comments, and edits must be logged, and signed
- Signature function will be very important
- Edits/additions to files need to be logged
- Vets must be able to sign
- Force signature before document closure?
** Schedule
- Would be great to see times and stuff
- Basic calendar function
- Linking address to google maps
- Doesn't like google calendar API because google owns it
    + Because there is a patient client confidentiality issue
- Need make and model of tablet
- Connie → organizer doing scheduling
- Whoever isn't a technician or a vet don't have access
- How will account creation work?
- All recorded notes cannot be edited, but a finalization period would be
  acceptable (2 days)
** Contacts
- May expand the number of tables, but 1-2 total
- Click on schedule → shows info
- Frequently is multiple users editing the same thing, on the same tablet
- Vets, techs
- Volunteers
- Contacts for labs/other vet clinics
- Main phone, fax, email, address
** Inventory
- Medications
- Pet food -> in stock = in van
    + Make an order = list of things they need to pick up (food & medical)
- More so what the van should be stocked with
